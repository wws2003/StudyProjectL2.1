# StudyProjectL2.1
More technical-advanced C++ projects. Focusing on (modestly) advanced data structures and algorithms, and parallelism techniques to enhances those algorithms. Currently working on Bitonic sort with OpenCL implementation. Work-stealing thread pool is considered as next project. 

â€» The project SimpleOpenCLLib aims to provide more user-friendly and simplified API for OpenCL, so that users can concentrate more on the logic of their algorithm rather than repeatedly write OpenCL-related stuffs. This project (including documentation work) is still in progress, though it is used by MatrixVectorOperationsOpenCL and BitonicSortOpenCL
